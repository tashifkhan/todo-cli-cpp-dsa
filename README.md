## **Problem Statement**

Develop a user-friendly and efficient to-do list application to help users prioritize, categorize, and track tasks. The application will serve as an organizational tool for users handling various workloads.

### **Key Objectives**  
1. **Task Management**  
   - Create, edit, and delete tasks.  
   - Assign due dates, reminders, and priorities.  

2. **Task Categorization**  
   - Implement tagging for task categories.  
   - Allow filtering and sorting based on categories.  

3. **Progress Tracking**  
   - Visualize task completion with progress bars or checkmarks.  
   - Maintain a history of completed tasks.  

4. **User Experience**  
   - Design an intuitive interface with responsive and visually appealing elements.  

5. **Additional Features**  
   - Add note-taking capabilities for detailed task descriptions.  
   - Suggest important tasks using prioritization algorithms.  



## **Solution Approach**

### 1. **User Interface Design**
- An intuitive and responsive design adaptable to multiple devices.  
- Visual indicators (e.g., icons, checkmarks) for task status.  

### 2. **Task Management**
- Add, edit, remove, and mark tasks as complete.  
- Store tasks efficiently in hierarchical or structured data formats.  

### 3. **Task Prioritization**
- Assign priority levels to tasks.  
- Use scheduling algorithms to organize tasks by urgency and importance.  

### 4. **Due Date and Notification System**
- Notify users about upcoming deadlines via reminders.  
- Offer snooze/postpone options for flexible workload management.  

### 5. **Task Categorization**
- Tag tasks for efficient categorization.  
- Enable filtering/sorting based on categories or tags.  

### 6. **Advanced Search**
- Implement robust search functionalities with fuzzy search to handle typos.  

### 7. **Undo/Redo and Version Control**
- Provide undo/redo actions for task modifications.  
- Maintain a history of changes for version control.  

### 8. **Task Dependencies**
- Manage task relationships using dependency graphs.  
- Prevent dependent tasks from completion before prerequisite tasks.  

### 9. **Task Visualization**
- Incorporate Gantt charts or kanban boards for progress tracking.  



## **Data Structures Used and Why**

### **Current Data Structures**
1. **Vector**  
   - Stores a flat list of tasks, offering simplicity and quick access.  

### **Proposed Enhancements**
1. **Tree Data Structure**  
   - Represents hierarchical relationships (parent/child tasks).  
   - Facilitates efficient task retrieval and dependency management.  

2. **Hash Table**  
   - Manages task categories for fast lookup and sorting.  

3. **Priority Queue**  
   - Prioritizes tasks for quick retrieval of high-priority tasks.  

### **Benefits**
- Enhanced organization for complex tasks and dependencies.  
- Optimized task prioritization and retrieval.  
- Reduced memory usage for larger datasets.  



## **Implementation**

### **Programming Language and Libraries**
- **Language:** C++  
- **Libraries:** None (lightweight and platform-independent implementation).  

### **Key Components**
1. **Task Class**  
   - Attributes: `name`, `status`, `priority`, `dueDate`, `categories`, `reminderDate`, and `dependencies`.  

2. **Task Management Features**  
   - **Add Task:** Creates a new task with default status and priority.  
   - **Remove Task:** Deletes a specified task while tracking changes in an undo stack.  
   - **Mark Complete:** Updates task status to "Complete."  

3. **Undo/Redo Mechanism**  
   - Uses two stacks (`undoStack` and `redoStack`) to track task modifications.  

4. **Task Dependencies**  
   - Establishes relationships between tasks using a dependency graph.  

5. **Task Prioritization**  
   - Utilizes a priority queue to prioritize tasks dynamically.  

6. **Visualization**  
   - Progress bars and kanban boards for task tracking.
